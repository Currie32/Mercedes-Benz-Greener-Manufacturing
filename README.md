# Mercedes-Benz-Greener-Manufacturing
My work for Kaggle's Mercedes-Benz Greener Manufacturing competition. This project uses Python and TensorFlow to build a feed-forward neural network. Random search is extensively used to find the best network architecture and hyperparameter values. The best models' predictions were combined to create my submission.
